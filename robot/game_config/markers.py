Hiiii!
This file contains the definitions for the markers and the data we assign to them. 
I have just set them to 2024's competition values, with MARKER_TYPE deciding whether a marker is part of 
the ARENA walls, or a game object, which is this year (2023-2024) called a POTATO. So make the changes you 
need! But make sure to change every reference to it in the code, not just the ones in this file.
So go nuts! Good luck with your Robocon, and feel free to add your own messages for the future below!
Byee!

Hello
I've updated this for 2025 and renamed the movable boxes to BOXs. This is just an internal name and
mostly shouldn't be visible to the users. In 2025 they are dealing with Sheep, Gems and Lair markers.

        Get a marker object from an id

        Marker IDs are greater than 0, and usually won't go higher than 200. They are 
        read as April tags, so use an online 6x6 April tag generator to test values, 
        such as:
        https://chaitanyantr.github.io/apriltag (remember to set to tag36h11 for this one)

        In 2025 low marker IDs (0-39) are Sheep and Gems.

        Markers 24-31 are Gems, with a pair of markers for each team.

        Markers The rest of the low markers are unowned - their owning_team property is ARENA.

        It is probably recommendable that you have duplicate marker IDs, so that any damaged
        marker can be replaced by one with equivalent game meaning - in 2024 we made ID 0 and 
        ID 20 equivalent.

        Higher marker IDs (40+) will be part of the arena. These markers will be
        spaced as in 2021-2022's competition (6 markers on each side of the Arena,
        the first 50cm away from the wall and each subsequent marker 1m away from
        there). In practice these markers start at 100.

        In 2025 there are also Lair markers, one of each of the team's lairs. These are numbered 50-53.
